    "synopsis": "<p>Kidnapped and suffering the diabolical torturous ways of “The Crude Surgeon” for no known reason, Michael slips in and out of consciousness until he finds himself in safe hands...</p><p>“Surgery” was conceived by Brian Clemens before he sadly passed away in January 2015. As a result “The Clemens Bros” made it their mission to bring his last vision to life to play tribute to their father and all his wonderful work.</p><p>Brian’s last ever script was a feature he and his son Samuel had been working on together called “The Still” and “Surgery” was born out Brian’s truly ingenious mind as a way to help secure funding for “The Still”. If you’d like to know more about the feature or would like to help in bringing this project to life please check out our current projects for more information.</p>",
